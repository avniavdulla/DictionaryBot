# DictionaryBot
This is a simple python program that updates a twitter account's status two times a day.
A word is randomly picked from a list, then searches the Oxford Dictionary API to find its defenition. Then the word and the definition are tweeted. 

This was a fun project to practice sifting through json format, and to practice using an API.
